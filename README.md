# Home-Automation-using-Raspberry-Pi

This project aims to use Python scripting to automate menial functions like switching on lights, turning on the AC using Raspberry Pi.

## What you will need ##

1. Python installed on your computer
2. Telebot (app on phone)
3. Raspberry Pi with a microSD card
4. LEDs, motors and fans (optional)

## How to run ##

1. Open main.py which contains all the code needed.
2. Burn the code file to the microSD card as an image. Insert the card onto the board.
3. Connect Raspberry Pi to your computer via the USB. Boot it up and interface using Putty or any other serial terminal.

### Alternate way:

* Download Raspbian OS (preferably Jessie) and burn the image file to the SD card along with the code file.
* Next, boot the board to see the Linux OS i.e. Raspbian OS. Use the in-built terminal to run the code.
